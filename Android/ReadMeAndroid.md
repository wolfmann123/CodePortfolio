# Android Electronic Book Reader Project
## Introduction
The EReader project was a project for my Android programming class. 

The project was to create an app that could download books, read books, jump to locations in a book, change text size, and keep track of a user's place in a book.

The project used a library of books determined by the teacher, the list was online and not to have copyright issues (free use). 

The EReader was a project assigned to a pair of students; my partner and I both worked on the code for the project. 


## Set up
The project is was developed running alongside a pixel 2 with API 26. 

Android Studio was used for development and creation.

To run the project one would need Android Studio, and to open the "LibraryView" folder as a project in Android Studio.

## Future Development Ideas
I would like to fix some of the current bugs, like clicking "Read" on a book that is not downloaded causes it to crash.

I am curious how to develop with other softwares as well, since Android Studio was very buggy and tedious to use.
